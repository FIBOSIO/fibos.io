slogan = Developer-friendly Blockchain Ecosystem
desc = Combines JavaScript Development + BANCOR Protocol Smart Token + Developer Service, FIBOS platform provides fast development, rapid deployment with a stable and liquid token system to help developers enter the era of blockchain in one step.
joinin = Join DEV Community
ExchangeFo = Exchange FO SmartToken
QuickDev = Rapid development of blockchains with JavaScript
QuickDevDesc = FIBOS supports developing blockchain smart contracts with JavaScript. It solved the problems of difficult deployment of the blockchain environment, high threshold for development and learning, primitive testing tools, long iteration period, primitive development ecology, high operating cost and non-auditable contracts. 
StartLearn = Get Started > >
Characteristic = Technical Features and Service Advantages of FIBOS
Fast = Extremely Fast Speed of Development and Deployment
LowLearn = Low threshold for learning and environment deployment. Fast iteration speed. No compilation required. Good code readability. Compatible with npm ecology. Beginner developers who have no experience in blockchain project are able to implement their first available blockchain project with FIBOS within 1 hour, which is more efficient compared to other blockchain development work that based on C++ or other languages.
LessRes = Less Resource Usage
LessRam = Less RAM usage for storage. Less RAM usage for execution. Less CPU usage. Through calculation and prediction, the RAM usage of developing a equivalent service contract with FIBOS is only 10% of the usage with EOS. Thus, FIBOS helps developers to enter the blockchain development market quickly with extremely low investment.
Security = Secure and Controllable
Sandbox = Isolated sandbox enables global level isolation and VFS, and supports timeout detection. After 6 years of development experience of the FIBJS project and 6 months of continuous development and testing of the FIBOS project, FIBOS keeps secure and stable in both development and production environments, saving a lot of time for developers.
Auditable = Auditable Contract Code
JavaScriptDev = The contract code is developed with JavaScript. Being open source, it is accessible by anyone to audit the code and its logic, which can avoid the WASM contract is not auditable after compilation.
Stable = Stable and Liquid Token System
Bancor = FIBOS develops a smart token system based on Bancor Protocol, implements the functions of token issuance, transaction, exchange, etc. Using the built-in FO smart token in FIBOS, developers can focus on developing DApp without worrying about the logic of token issuance and transaction.
Onestep = One-step Complete Solution
FIBOSDev = FIBOS provides development tools, token protocol and services for developers. Developers can use FIBOS to start blockchain development and publication in one step. In addition, the FIBOS foundation will also operate the developer community to provide follow-up services such as consultation, training and exchange for developers.
