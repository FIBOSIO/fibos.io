Buy = Exchange
Pass = Smart Token 
slogan = Developer-friendly Block Chain Ecosystem
desc = JavaScript Development + BANCOR Protocol Smart Token + Developer Service. FIBOS platform provides rapid development, rapid deployment and a stable and flowing token system to help developers enter the era of block chain in one step.

QuickDev = Rapid Development of Blockchains with JavaScript
QuickDevDesc = FIBOS supports developing blockchain smart contracts with JavaScript, relieves the problems of difficult deployment of the blockchain environment, high threshold for development and learning, primitive testing tools, long iteration period, primitive development ecology, high operating cost and non-auditable contracts. 
StartLearn = Get Started > >
Characteristic = Technical Features and Service Advantages of FIBOS
Fast = Extremely Fast Speed of Development and Deployment
LowLearn = Low threshold for learning and environment deployment. Fast iteration speed. No compilation required. Good code readability. Compatible with NPM ecology. Usually, developers who have never been in contact with block chain projects before can implement their first available block chain project with FIBOS in 1 hour , which is more efficient compared to other block chain development work based on C++ or other languages.
LessRes = Less Resource Usage
LessRam = Less RAM usage for storage. Less RAM usage for execution. Less CPU usage. Through calculation and prediction, the RAM usage of developing a equivalent service contract with FIBOS is 10% of that of developing with EOS. FIBOS helps developers enter the block chain development market quickly with extremely low investment.
Security = Secure and Controllable
Sandbox = Isolated sandbox enables global level isolation and VFS, and supports timeout detection. After 6 years of development experience of the FIBJS project and 6 months of continuous development and testing of the FIBOS project, FIBOS keeps secure and stable in both development and production environments, saving a lot of time for developers.
Auditable = Auditable Contract Code
JavaScriptDev = The contract code is developed with JavaScript. And it is open source. Anyone can audit the code and its logic, which can avoid the problem that the WASM contract is not auditable after compilation.
Stable = Stable and Flowing Token System
Bancor = FIBOS develops a smart token system based on Bancor Protocol, implements the functions of token issurance, transaction, exchange, etc. Using the FO Smart Token built in the FIBOS, developers can focus on developing DApp without worring about the logic of token issurance and transaction.
Onestep = An One-step Complete Solution
FIBOSDev = FIBOS provides development tools, token protocol and services for developers. Developers can use FIBOS to start block chain development and publication in one step. In addition, the FIBOS foundation will also operate the developer community to provide follow-up services such as consultation, training and exchange for developers.
